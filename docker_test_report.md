# Docker Execution Instructions Test Report

## Test Environment
- Docker version: 27.4.1
- Operating System: Linux devin-box 5.10.223
- Repository: PX0661/teachable_machine

## Libraries Docker Instructions Test Results

### Original Dockerfile Issues
The original Dockerfile in the libraries directory has package installation issues:
```dockerfile
FROM node:16

RUN apt-get install gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libc6 \
  libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 \
  libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 \
  libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 \
  libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 \
  libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates \
  fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils wget
```

The issue is that the `apt-get update` command is missing before the package installation, which causes the build to fail because the package lists are not up to date.

### Modified Dockerfile Test
I created a modified Dockerfile.test with the necessary changes:
```dockerfile
FROM node:16

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libc6 \
  libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 \
  libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 \
  libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 \
  libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 \
  libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates \
  fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils wget

# Install latest chrome dev package and fonts to support major charsets
# Note: this installs the necessary libs to make the bundled version of Chromium that Puppeteer
# installs, work.
RUN wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add - \
  && sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list' \
  && apt-get update \
  && apt-get install -y google-chrome-unstable libxtst6 libxss1 fonts-ipafont-gothic fonts-wqy-zenhei fonts-thai-tlwg fonts-kacst fonts-freefont-ttf \
  --no-install-recommends \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENTRYPOINT ["npm"]
```

### Test Results
- The Docker image build was successful with the modified Dockerfile.
- The Docker container ran successfully and displayed the npm run-script help information.
- The original Dockerfile in the repository has package installation issues that need to be addressed.

## Converter Services Docker Instructions Test Results

### Original docker-compose.yml
The original docker-compose.yml file in the snippets/converter directory:
```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  tiny:
    build: tiny
    image: converter-tiny:latest
    ports:
      - "9001:8080"
  image:
    build: image
    image: converter-image:latest
    ports:
      - "9002:8080"
  audio:
    build: audio
    image: converter-audio:latest
    ports:
      - "9003:8080"
```

### Issues with Converter Services
When attempting to build the Docker images for the converter services using docker-compose, I encountered several issues:

1. The image Dockerfile is trying to install a specific version of the edgetpu-compiler package (version 15.0) that is not available:
```
E: Version '15.0' for 'edgetpu-compiler' was not found
```

2. I created a modified Dockerfile.test for the image converter service to test the Docker-related instructions without the problematic package:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.6

RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install fastapi==0.41.0 pydantic==0.32.2 Pillow==6.2.0 starlette==0.12.9 six==1.12.0 uvicorn==0.9.0 promise==2.2.1 httptools==0.0.13 gunicorn==19.9.0 python-multipart==0.0.5 aiofiles==0.4.0
RUN pip install tensorflowjs==2.0.1
RUN pip install scipy==1.4.1
RUN pip install tensorflow==2.3.0

WORKDIR /app
COPY api.py ./
CMD exec gunicorn --bind :8080  -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 300 --reload  api:app
```

3. I created a modified docker-compose.test.yml file to test the Docker-related instructions without the problematic package:
```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  image:
    build:
      context: ./image
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.test
    image: converter-image-test:latest
    ports:
      - "9002:8080"
```

4. When running the Docker container for the image converter service, it exited with an error related to TensorFlow dependencies:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'LayerNormalization'
```

### Test Results
- The Docker image build for the converter services failed with the original Dockerfile due to package version issues.
- The Docker image build was successful with the modified Dockerfile.test.
- The Docker container for the image converter service started but immediately exited with an error related to TensorFlow dependencies.
- The service was not accessible at the specified port.
- The original docker-compose.yml file in the repository has issues with package versions and dependencies that need to be addressed.

## Snippets Execution Instructions Test Results

### package.json
The package.json file in the snippets directory:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "http-server": "^14.1.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "http-server --cors snippets",
    "lint": "markdownlint ./markdown ./converter"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "markdownlint-cli": "^0.33.0"
  }
}
```

### Test Results
- The package.json file includes a start script that uses http-server to serve the snippets.
- The README.md instructions for serving the snippets locally are accurate.

## Recommendations for Improving Docker-Related Instructions

1. **Libraries Dockerfile**:
   - Add `apt-get update` before package installation in the Dockerfile for the libraries directory:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gconf-service libasound2 ...
   ```

2. **Converter Services**:
   - Update the docker-compose.yml file to use available package versions or provide alternative instructions for the converter services.
   - Consider using a more recent version of Python (e.g., Python 3.8 or later) for the converter services.
   - Address the TensorFlow dependency issues in the Docker containers by using compatible versions of TensorFlow and related packages.

3. **README.md Updates**:
   - Add a note about potential issues and troubleshooting steps in the README.md file:
   ```markdown
   ### Troubleshooting Docker
   
   If you encounter issues with Docker builds:
   
   1. Make sure to update package lists before installation:
      ```bash
      apt-get update
      ```
   
   2. For converter services, you may need to use compatible versions of Python and TensorFlow:
      ```bash
      # Example of compatible versions
      FROM python:3.8
      RUN pip install tensorflow==2.4.0
      ```
   
   3. If you encounter TensorFlow dependency issues, try using a different version of TensorFlow or installing additional dependencies.
   ```

4. **General Docker Best Practices**:
   - Use specific versions for base images and dependencies to ensure reproducibility.
   - Include proper error handling and logging in Docker containers.
   - Consider using multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
   - Add healthchecks to Docker containers to monitor their status.

## Conclusion
The Docker execution instructions added to the README.md file are generally accurate but have some issues that need to be addressed. The main issues are:

1. The Dockerfile for the libraries directory needs to include `apt-get update` before package installation to ensure that the package lists are up to date.
2. The docker-compose.yml file for the converter services has issues with package versions and dependencies that need to be addressed.
3. The Docker containers for the converter services have TensorFlow dependency issues that need to be resolved.

These issues should be documented in the README.md file, along with troubleshooting steps or alternative instructions, to ensure that users can successfully run the application using Docker.
